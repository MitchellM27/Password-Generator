# Password-Generator

## Task: Creating a password generator using parameters set by the user.
* Goal: To properly exhibit skills learned with Javascript to create a password generator that is integrated into a webpage. It will contain existing files in the formats of HTML and CSS, and will require a javascript code addition in order to make the site work properly.  
* Specifications: The site must maintain its user interface while additions to the webpage's functionality are made. At the projects beginning, no intereractions with the webpage can be made by the user. A button exists but it is not yet functional. Upon completion this button will be operable and will allow the user to generate a random password within a certain set of parameters that they've chosen. This includes being case sensitive, allowing for special characters, and choosing whether or not numbers will be included. 
* Points of Emphasis: This project will specifically exhibit newly attained skills in javascript. The creation of variables, use of functions, utilization of loops, and interactive prompt windows are imperative to the code's success in this project.  
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning HTML, CSS, javascript and READ.ME files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the Link is shown here: https://mitchellm27.github.io/Password-Generator/

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
